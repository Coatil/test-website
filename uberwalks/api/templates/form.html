      <h1>Welcome to UberWalk!</h1>
      <p>This is our submission for the 2023 Uber Global Hackthon.</p>
      <p>By Kirk Poppa, Thomas Duong, Andrew Li, and Luiz Guilherme .</p>
      <p>
        Our application calculates the pickup point between the user and their destination. This
        pickup point is special: it takes both the user and the driver an equal
        amount of time to arrive at this location. This ensures that the person
        is encouraged to walk, while the car drives less as the path towards the
        destination is more direct. Ultimately, neither the driver nor the user
        has to wait for each other, as they arrive to the pickup point at the
        same time.
      </p>

      <p>To use our application, follow these instructions very carefully.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Our application takes 3 addresses. The addresses required are labeled
          next to each box.
        </li>
        <li>
          The addresses must be in this <strong>EXACT</strong> format: street #
          street name, city, Canada. Ex: 1455 Glen Abbey Gate, Oakville, Canada
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, the safest way to input a valid address is use the address
          provided by Google Maps when you search for this location. Ex: This
          address "1455 Glen Abbey Gate, Oakville, ON L6M 2G5" is completely
          valid, and it was taken from Google Maps.
        </li>
        <li>
          Press submit, and you will be displayed with the pickup point and how long it takes to walk there. You will also see a map showcasing your location and the pickup location.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will also see the savings in dollars.
        </li>
      </ol>
