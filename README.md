# 2023 Uber Global Hackathon Hyperson\<ic\> team Submission\: UberWalks

UberWalks is a web application developed by Hyperson<i>c as the submission for the coding track of the 2023 Uber Global Hackathon. The application takes three user-input addresses: the user's address, the destination address, and the driver's address. With this, the application calculates an optimal pickup point where the user and the driver arrives at the same time. 

UberWalks take advantage of Flask, a web framework that allows the Python backend to be displayed using HTML frontend. To host our application, Vercel is used. We used these technologies and languages because they are simple and fast, and they are adequate for our purposes.
