# 2023 Uber Global Hackathon Hyperson\<i\>c team Submission\: UberWalks

UberWalks is a web application developed by Hyperson\<i\>c as the submission for the coding track of the 2023 Uber Global Hackathon. The application takes three user-input addresses\: the user's address, the destination address, and the driver's address. With this, the application calculates an optimal pickup point where the user and the driver arrives at the same time. 

UberWalks take advantage of Flask, a web framework that allows the Python backend to be displayed using HTML frontend. To host our application, Vercel is used. We used these technologies and languages because they are simple and fast, and they are adequate for our purposes.

## Using the Application
To use the application, click this [link](https://uber-walks-mifkqappa-hyperson1c.vercel.app/) <br>

You will be shown a landing page with instructions and an HTML form at the button. After entering in the addresses and clicking the submit button, you will be shown the pickup location, how long it takes to walk there, the savings, and a map. <br> 

Here are example addresses\: <br>
your location\: 110 Wellesley St W, Toronto, ON M7A 1A2 <br>
your destination\: 290 Bremner Blvd, Toronto, ON M5V 3L9 <br>
the driver's location\: 235 Bloor St E, Toronto, ON M4W 1C8 <br>
